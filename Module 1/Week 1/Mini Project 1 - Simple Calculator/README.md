# Simple Calculator

## Overview
This Java project implements a console-based calculator supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. It utilizes java.util.Scanner for input handling and includes error management for invalid inputs and division by zero scenarios.

## Structure
The project includes:
Main Class: Contains the main method for user interaction and operation execution.
Calculator Class: Provides methods (add, subtract, multiply, divide) for arithmetic operations and input validation.

##Usage
- Run the Main class.
- Select an operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for division).
- Enter numbers as prompted.
- Choose whether to continue computing or exit after each operation.
- 
##Error Handling
-Handles invalid input (non-numeric entries).
-Prevents division by zero with appropriate error messages.

##Conclusion
This project serves as a basic example of a Java console application, demonstrating essential concepts like user input handling, exception management, and arithmetic operations.
